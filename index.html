                Back in 2013, Sébastien, my brother Romain and I decided to launch a coding school to teach creative and entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their own tech products through an intensive 9-week bootcamp. At that time, none of us had real design or branding skills. My brother was a lawyer. Sébastien and I were both engineers (French engineers, aka the worst kind in terms of design background 😬).

                We only knew one thing: we wanted to build a program to teach people the technical skills and tools to bring their ideas to life. This program would go far beyond “becoming a full-stack developer” or “learning UX/UI Design, HTML, CSS, ruby and Javascript”. For us, these skills were also a prerequisite for anyone who wanted to develop tech projects autonomously in their current job, start a freelancing career or launch their own startup. And we felt that traditional degrees’ courses were failing to provide students with these new tech skills. As we say in French…

                An idiom that could be literally translated into: “Higher education has missed the train”. This was the first time we thought of the word “wagon” for our brand name. After giving it some more thought, it seemed like a cool name for different reasons:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-centered">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It points to this idea of a “missing block” or “missing wagon” in the “train of higher education”.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A wagon is a vehicle that takes a group of people (like a class of students) on a journey to a destination. This is exactly what our coding bootcamp is about!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>We didn’t want a brand name using words like “hack”, “code”, “tech”, “app”, etc… For us, <strong>code is a means to develop products and reach your goals, not an end in itself.</strong></p>
